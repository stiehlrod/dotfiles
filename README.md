# dotfiles
Steps

1) Prepare your Brewfile.

2) Install brew bundle command
```$ brew tap Homebrew/bundle```

3) Install Homebrew
```./set_up_homebrew.zsh ```

4) Run the command to 'source' your zshrc file, whereever it is located. I created a directory called Github for all of my personal repos.
```source ~/Github/dotfiles/zshrc   ```
