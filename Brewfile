A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
/opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@3/certs

and run
/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin/c_rehash

openssl@3 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS provides LibreSSL.

If you need to have openssl@3 first in your PATH, run:
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include"

For pkg-config to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib/pkgconfig" 

Linking /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@3/3.0.0_1... 5482 symlinks created.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH instead consider running:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
